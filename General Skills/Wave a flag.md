>Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? This program has extraordinarily helpful information...

After downloading the given file 'warm', I ran the command `$ chmod +x warm` to be able to run it, then ran `$ ./warm` to see what it did.

It then prompted me with

> Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!

After rerunning the command with the -h flag, I was given the following output:

> Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_616f7182}

CTF done.
