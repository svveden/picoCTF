Going to the given website, I don't see much. I've never heard a header file be called a copybook before which is interesting.

After opening the inspector to get a closer look and looking through the different tabs I find half the flag in the `style editor` section:

```
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/*  picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_  */
```

Then, I found the other half in the debugger section under the script.js file:

```
function greetings()
{
  alert("This code is in a separate file!");
}

//  f7w_2of2_4d305f36}
```

I have the key!
