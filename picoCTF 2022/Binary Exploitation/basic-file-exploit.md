## Description

>The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it! Connect to the program with netcat: $ nc saturn.picoctf.net 49700

To solve this one I just looked at the given source code of the file and noticed this:

```
 if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
    puts(flag);
    fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
    exit(0);
  }
  ```
  
  So it appears that if I send it something thats not a number as my entry for printing out strings already on the server it'll just give me the flag.

Sure enough.
